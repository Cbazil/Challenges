    <h1><u>My Day</u></h1>
    <p>
        This morning I woke up <strong>later</strong> than usual so I had to rush. I <strong>skipped breakfast</strong> this morning as I still
        have to take my brother <br> to school in the morning so as soon as we were done we drove. The <em>traffic</em> to the
        R300 was not as heavy as usual but once I got <br> down to the Mitchell's Plain turn off I was driving basically
        <strong> <em>walking speed</em> </strong>, however still managed to make it to class on time.
