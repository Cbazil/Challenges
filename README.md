# Challenges
Today we done our first web page. We started off with the headings, and there are 6 different headings. We also checked how to change the font by adding the bold, underline or italics. After we created a paragraph and used break to cut it off in the middle. Then we created an unordered list and a ordered list. Finally we added an image to our web page.
